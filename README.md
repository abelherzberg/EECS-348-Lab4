# EECS-348-Lab4
This lab includes two programming problems:
1. NFL Score combinations:
   Takes in an NFL score and provides all possible scoring combinations of safeties, field goals, touchdowns, touchdowns with PAT, and touchdowns with 2pt conversions, that can occur based on a given score from the user of the program.
2. Temperature Conversion:
   Takes in a temperature value from the user, a scale for that temperature(째F, 째C, K) and a conversion scale(째F, 째C, K). It converts the temperature from the given scale to the desired scale and provides insight on how comfortable the temperature is, and a sentence to recommend how to handle the temperature.
